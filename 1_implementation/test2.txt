read result == bytes read except when nthn to read it will be -1
if (bytesread == BUFFER_SIZE && staticvar does not include '\n)
	read again;
	check again if bytesread < BUFFER_SIZE << reached end of file
		return everything in static variable, free and return the copy

first check static is line; 

buff, i = 1
I\nlike\nme\0
01 23456 789

like\nme\0\0\0
01234 567 8 9

temp = malloc(i + 2) = malloc (3).

j = 0 to j = i
temp[j] = buff[j], at indexes 1 and 2. correct.

j = 0, while buff[j]

if (j > strlen(buff) - i [8]) --> j = 7 to j = 8

else --> j = 0 to j = 6
buff[j] = buff[j + i + 1]
buff[0] = buff[2]
